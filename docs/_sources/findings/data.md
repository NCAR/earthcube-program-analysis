# Data-Oriented Outcomes 

Datasets and software were major outcomes of Earthcube projects.  In total there were eleven (11) DOIs which were found in Datacite (and not in Crossref): 

* Four (4) datasets, 
* Three (3) articles or reports, 
* Three (3) software packages , and 
* one image/graphic/poster.  

It is likely there are more that were not capture with our analysis, but these  outcomes nonetheless represent major and important activity of the program, and should be considered on equal footing with the other publications.

## Highlights

## Interpretation

Beyond peer-reviewed publications, these eleven resources produced by EarthCube funding have been assigned DOIs in Datacite, and the three articles / reports might be investigated further to determine why there are not published as peer-reviewed publications.

The total number of items in the list is ~1% of all the analyzed outcomes (publications), and it is unclear what the _expected_ rate of these assets should be.  The EarthCube project has large computational infrastructure projects, and so it would be expected that more datasets and software appear in this list -- indeed, many more than three software products have been produced by EarthCube projects.

For future projects, additional resources and guidance (such as that of the software citation recommendation](https://earthcube.org/sw-citation)) are needed to enable data and software citation and identification, as well as a clear path for technical works that are not publications.
