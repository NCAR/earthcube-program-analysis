# DataCite Outcomes 

Datasets, software and other digital outputs were major outcomes of Earthcube projects.  At the moment, [DataCite](https://datacite.org) is a key source for minting DOIs for non-publication digital objects.  While DataCite stores its own metadata, Crossref now also stores this metadata, making lookup and retrieval more consistent from a single source. We use the Crossref metadata for consistency, but the original DataCite metadata is also stored.  **Note:** We do not report citation counts because these resources typically do not have such counts, but the landscape is constantly changing and in the near future we can expect to see more of these types of resources be counted in the same way publications are today.

In total there were eleven (11) DOIs which were found in Datacite (and not in Crossref): 

* Four (4) datasets, 
* Three (3) articles or reports, 
* Three (3) software packages, and 
* one image/graphic/poster.  

It is likely there are more that were not capture with our analysis, but these  outcomes nonetheless represent major and important activity of the program, and should be considered on equal footing with the other publications.

## Highlights
```{admonition} Data Highlights
* 11 DOIs were minted in [DataCite](datacite.org)
* 4 DOIs were minted for datasets
* one project minted 2 dataset DOIs
* one project minted 2 software DOIs

## Interpretation

Beyond peer-reviewed publications, these eleven resources produced by EarthCube funding have been assigned DOIs in DataCite, and the three articles / reports might be investigated further to determine if they could have been appropriately published as peer-reviewed publications.

The total number of items in the list is <1% of all the analyzed outcomes (publications), and it is unclear what the _expected_ rate of these assets should be.  The EarthCube project has large computational infrastructure projects, and so it would be expected that more datasets and software appear in this list -- indeed, many more than three software products have been produced by EarthCube projects.

For future projects, additional resources and guidance (such as that of the [software citation recommendation](https://kmaull-ucar.github.io/ec-sw-citation/)) are needed to enable data and software citation and identification, as well as a clear path for technical works that are not publications.
