# Altmetrics Outcomes 

Altmetric provides significant insight into the attention scholarly works get on social media and other platforms.  While many works get no attention, some get significant attention on platforms like Twitter or on popular blogs or on news outlets.  Here is a sampling of some of the most impactful Altmetric scores -- note that scores above 500 are among the top 5% of all Altmetric scores, and while scores vary in their power as predictors of citation counts {cite}`syamili_altmetric_2017, chang_correlation_2019, huang_correlation_2018, wang_impact_2020, yang_comparison_2021,kolahi_meta-analysis_2021`  they are still valuable.

## Highlights
```{admonition} Altmetric Highlights
* most of top 10 highest scoring altmetric **papers were published between 2017-2020**.
* the [top paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.88) was a database tool
  * A global multiproxy database for temperature reconstructions of the Common Era (doi: [10.1038/sdata.2017.88](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.88))

## Interpretation

Altmetric scores indicate attention that articles get across social media, blogs, news outlets, and other web sites. Previous research has shown that papers with higher altmetric attention are likely to receive more citations subsequently {cite}`shuai_how_2012,huang_correlation_2018-1,klar_using_2020,akella_early_2021`.

Many of the same papers that are included in the ["highly cited papers" table](/findings/publications.html#top-10-most-cited-papers) are also in the top Altmetric list, but the ranking order does vary. 

Surprisingly, the paper receiving the most citations, ["Big Data and cloud computing: innovation opportunities and challenges"](https://doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2016.1239771), does not show up on this list of Altmetric score.

The #2-4 papers on the "highly cited papers" list, however, are toward the top of this list of Altmetric score, being ranked #2, 5, and 1 respectively. 

The article ranked highest by Altmetric score that did not appear at the top of the "highly cited papers" table is the #11 item, "Rising Oceans Guaranteed: Arctic Land Ice Loss and Sea Level Rise," published in 2018.

Three other papers appear on this list of top Altmetric papers, but did not appear on the "highly cited papers" list. All three of these papers were also published 2018 or later. This suggests that Altmetric score might provide an indicator of impact and reception in the years immediately following a paper’s publication, before citation counts have had time to accrue. The papers:

* 2019 - PaCTS 1.0: A Crowdsourced Reporting Standard for Paleoclimate Data
* 2020 - Planet Microbe: a platform for marine microbiology to discover and analyze interconnected ‘omics and environmental data
* 2018 - Libra: scalablek-mer–based tool for massive all-vs-all metagenome comparisons

show an example of this effect.
